This game is filled with RNG / skinner box bullshit, so here's some stuff to alleviate it.

- achievement_unlocker
    - Adds an unlock button to achievement detail menu.
- dlc_unlocker
    - Unlocks DLCs based on Steam app id. Defined in the `unlock_app_ids`-variable.
- experience_giver
    - Adds a mod menu from which you can give continental coins and experience.
- bot_weapon_edits
    - Edit bot weapon stats.
